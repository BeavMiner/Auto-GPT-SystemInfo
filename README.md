# System Information Plugin for Auto-GPT

## Overview

This plugin adds an extra line to the prompt, serving as a hint for the AI to use shell commands likely supported by the current system.
By incorporating this plugin, you can ensure that the AI model provides more accurate and system-specific shell commands, improving its overall performance and usefulness.

**Example Prompt Included in the Context:**

   - "Shell commands executed on Linux 64bit Debian GNU/Linux 11 (debian) in zsh"

This helps the model provide commands compatible with the current operating system, enabling it to use system-specific package managers and other utilities.
